# About

This repository contains patches for various software synthesizers. Often, these are remakes - clean-room reverse engineered - of the sounds you can hear in popular music. Others have a more academical approach - to teach or explain certain concepts.

I am not a fan of "studio secrets". I have been fortunate enough to learn from many people at no cost; it is only fitting that I return the favor for others, keeping the threshold as low as possible for everyone.

# Do you also take requests?

Yes! Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/synthrecipes/ and ask and there's a good chance I respond; that's where a lot of these patches also originate from.

# Versions

The subfolders denote the minimal version number that patches will run on. I will try to keep as many patches compatible with official 
releases, i.e. not any random beta.

tl,dr: you are free to use these patches, and attribution is very much appreciated, as is leaving the author's name intact - either in the metadata of the patch itself, or in the filename.

# Disclaimer

All patches are supplied as-is. All patches have been built from scratch. There are no patches in this repository from any commercially available soundsets. Some patches require additional samples to work. In most cases, they are not part of the patch itself; they have to be loaded separately. To keep everything coherent, they're wrapped in a ZIP file.

Any references to equipment, songs, artists, videogames or other media are solely used for illustration. The trademarks and copyright are property of their respective owners.
