# About

I'll be honest - I got Mini V as part of the Arturia Collection. Before, I already had u-he Diva and Native Instruments' Monark. I personally consider these to be better 
emulations, and some of the quirks that were an intrinsic part (but not necessarily a good thing) in the Minimoog were carried over in Mini V; like the fact that it's not possible 
to control the modulation wheel > LFO amount.

That said, its longevity and use is a good counter to the often-made point that "software synths are ephemeral".
