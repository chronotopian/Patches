# About

Native Instruments Massive is a testament to the longevity of software synthesizers - and their validity. It has one of the best user interfaces in the plugin world, where skeuomorphism runs rampant; its modulation system is elegant and refined, and the effects have a rare high quality. It is by far one of my favorite plugins to build sounds in.
