# About

Phaseplant is a ridiculously modular synthesizer. You just add all the parts you want and need, and you can stack various types of oscillators. Want parallel filters? You can have 'm - in triplicate.

Fortunately, it has a subscribe-to-own option - in case buying the entire toolbox in one go is a bit too rich for your blood. This is really nice - because otherwise you don't have that many effects in Phaseplant itself. Since the effects also double as standalone plugins, you really get your money's worth for them.
