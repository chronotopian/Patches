# About

Native Instruments FM8 was the reason I got into plugins. I managed to get FM7 for a discount and upgraded to FM8.

While the MSEGs (multi-segment envelope generators) were also present in the original (and in Absynth, which - 
let's be fair - introduced the whole concept), I generally found them to be more clunky than Massive's Performer system. For anything 
rhythmic, that is a better approach.

FM8 is in dire need of a graphical update and its user interface could be more elegant. Still, it's a pretty historic plugin that boldly
stepped away from anything subtractive. The freely routable operators are also nice, and can get awfully complex.
