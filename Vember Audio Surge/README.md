# Where to get (it's free!)

https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/

# How to load presets

* click on the "Menu" button in the bottom left of the plugin window
* Navigate to "Data and Patches" > "Open User Data Folder"
* If there's no folder in there yet, create one. Surge uses folder names as categories, so if the sound is a bass sound, create a folder called "Bass"
* Copy the .fxp file in there

Then:
* click on the "Menu" button again
* Navigate to "Data and Patches" and choose "Rescan all data folders"

Alternatively, if the instance of Surge is removed from the track and then loaded again, the patch folder will have been updated as well.

Just click on the "Patch Browser" window to choose from the list. The categories will show up in a dropdown menu.

# About

Surge is now open source and free to get. Formerly a commercial plugin, it's got a distinct character.

Its modulation system is really powerful - LFOs and envelopes can be used interchangeably. It can load and play back samples as well, in addition to loading custom wavetables.
Its FM system is quite powerful and has a clean sound. If you feel you can go beyond Synth1, get Surge; some of its capabilities rival those of much more expensive commercial synthesizers.
