# About

Serum is a great software synthesizer. It has arguably paved the way for a set of wavetable "supersynthesizers" - based on wavetables,
with a semi-modular approach, and with great versatility, often uniting several methods of synthesis under one system.

It incorporates several aspects of plugins that came before, such as Native Instruments' Massive - with the drag & drop modulation system.
From Native Instruments Absynth it also took inspiration, with the spectral editing of waveforms, the ability to build waveshapes by
means of drawing, summing harmonics, or importing samples. 

The ability to load custom wavetables is one important factor that sets it apart from Massive; and this has also been a benchmark for other
plugins that were released since.

# Versions

The subfolders denote the minimal version number that patches will run on. I will try to keep as many patches compatible with official 
releases, i.e. not any random beta.
