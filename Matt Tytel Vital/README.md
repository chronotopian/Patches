# About

Matt Tytel is well known for Helm - a great free software synthesizer. 3 years in the making and released in November 2020, Vital is an incredibly powerful wavetable "supersynth" that takes all the things that made Massive and Serum great and improves yet again on them.

The interface combines both drag & drop with a modulation matrix, and programming is fluent and accurate. There is no lack of modulation sources and targets, and important targets all run at audio rates.

Backed by a strong community with lots of skilled sound designers, this is an incredibly promising plugin with a bright future.
