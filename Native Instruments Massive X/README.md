# About

Native Instruments Massive X is the successor to Massive. Instead of doing "just more than what Massive X does", several things have been redesigned and rethought. The impulse envelope is a nice touch, as is the detailed "proper" noise. Instead of 4 LFOs and 4 envelopes, you get 9 modulation sources that can be either an LFO or an envelope.

While wavetables are still fixed - there's no way to load up your own - the noise generators can now load samples.

What I like best is that the filters have been upgraded; the new SVF sounds very juicy. Massive's regular filters were a bit "flat", and these sound much more pleasant. The more extensive distortion effects are also very nice, as is the built-in modulation oscillator.

However, Massive X now faces serious competition - Serum, Pigments and Phase Plant all vie for the throne, and in some regards (unison should've been per oscillator, wavetables should've been editable), it's coming up short.
