# About

Sylenth1 was one of the first true must-have software synthesizers for trance and EDM producers. In terms of spirit and impact, it's comparable to the Roland JP-8000 - but a bit more simplified. It has a low CPU usage, and high-quality modulation sources - routing the LFO to the pitch works perfectly and quality is retained.

In terms of capabilities, others have superseded it - but it's still reliable, and won't bring down your system when you crank up the unison.
