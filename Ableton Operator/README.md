# About

Operator is included in Ableton Live "Suite". It's a ridiculously capable and - very important! - user-friendly 4-operator FM synthesizer. It can even get close to some 6-operator sounds if you stack two of them, or use the waveform editor to generate more complex waveforms.

Since it has not been (visibly) updated since its introduction, I've chosen "v1" as a version number. Who knows, perhaps a v2 will one day be there.

The patches themselves have no effects included; this means that some still would be helped by some chorus and reverb.
