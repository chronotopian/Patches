# How to load presets

When Synth1 is installed, a number of folders are created. These are called `soundbank00`, `soundbank01`, `soundbank02` and so on. By default, only `soundbank00` is filled; the rest has a small text file that's used to prevent errors with unzipping.

When any .sy1 preset is copied in any soundbank folder, its filename must be a number between 001 and 128. The presets offered here don't have numerical names to make it easier to see what they sound like; this means you must rename them first in order to use them.

Click on the patch name window, and the soundbanks with readable presets will be shown.

# About

Whenever someone asks for free plugins, there's a good chance people will reply "Synth1". For obvious reasons - this plugin is modeled on the Clavia Nord Lead 2 but can do a little bit of extra. It's been around since 2002! It's an excellent basic synthesizer that is easy enough to learn synthesis with, but capable enough that it can make a wide variety of sounds. Its effects are basic but useful, and the unison sounds pretty good!
